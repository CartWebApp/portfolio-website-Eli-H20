                    <p>This is where I share some of the writing I’ve done. I’ve put together stories, essays, and other
                        stuff I’ve worked on, either for school or just for fun. Some of it’s serious, some of it’s
                        random, but it all shows how I’m growing as a writer.</p>

                <h2>Writing</h2>
                <p>This year in Mrs. Silva’s class, I wrote a mix of personal stories & essays. I learned
                    how to express my ideas more clearly, whether I was telling a story or breaking down a piece of
                    text. My writing improved in organization and detail, and I got better at making my voice come
                    through. Overall, I feel more confident in how I write and communicate my thoughts.
