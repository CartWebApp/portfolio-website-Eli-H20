            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a student attending The Center for Advanced Research and Technology. I am very proud of the work
                I’ve done these past two semesters. I’ve created multiple websites along with my peers, and done many
                exercises to better understand the criteria that we are learning. Guidance from my teachers has allowed
                me to get over my fear of speaking in front of people (mostly) which is a huge accomplishment for me. I
                enjoy reading in my free time as well as playing games, and hanging out with friends and family. After
                school I want to go to community college to figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life, and
                get my basic classes out of the way since community is free the first two years.
