        <p class="boax">I spent a lot of time learning about computers so that I could build my own. I studied a lot on how to put my computer together correctly, how to set up my BIOS settings and stuff, and how to download windows properly. I had help from the internet and my family, but now I can confidently say that I know how to build computers. I can still improve my craft by learning more about certain parts and what pieces go together better than others, as well as getting better at cable management and stuff. </p>
